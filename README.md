•	How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I have found that working with mongo in the past and in this class is much more easier to understand then it counterpart SQL. Working on the previous assignments using jupyter having to create tests for the functions was a great way to keep the code maintainable. 

•	How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Working on different project this term and the previous ones, the bast route in solving my code block problems was by analyzing the functionality of the code. Understanding the problem, I am solving, if I were not successful, I simply research the documentation of the package I am using. For example, working with the pie chart that was required for the module 7 project 2. I was stuck in trying to display my data from the database while the data read existed in the project the package would not display the required data. After examining my code with the example, I have fond I had a syntax issue that needed correcting. 

•	What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientist responsivities are designing developing and analyzing software and hardware. By doing that they solve problems and innovate the world of technology for latest and greatest product. For the project we have worked on this term we have solved designed, and developed a program that handles data from a server and created a virtualization to better display the data that is more readable to analyses.
